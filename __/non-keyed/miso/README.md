# miso-1.1.0.0-non-keyed

[Miso](https://haskell-miso.org) is a tasty [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) front-end framework.

## Installation

All needed `*.js` sources have already been generated in folder [`dist-bundle`](./dist-bundle) to avoid other dependencies of [`Haskell`](http://haskell.org/) and [`Nix`](https://nixos.org/nix/).

However, to build everything by yourself you have to use [`Nix`](https://nixos.org/nix/) to run `nix-build` from [`root` of miso-1.1.0.0.-non-keyed](./).

After that just run `npm run cp-js` (or `yarn cp-js`) to copy generated `*.js` sources from local Nix store to `dist-bundle` folder. This folder is used by running benchmarks.

Now you can start benchmarks by running
```
cd webdriver-ts
yarn selenium --count 3 --framework miso-1.1.0.0-non-keyed
```
(^ see [Running a single framework with the automated benchmark driver](../README#4-running-a-single-framework-with-the-automated-benchmark-driver))

An interactive table of results can be generated by
```
cd webdriver-ts
yarn interactive-results
```
(^ see [Optional 7. Building the interactive results table](../README#optional-7-building-the-interactive-results-table))
